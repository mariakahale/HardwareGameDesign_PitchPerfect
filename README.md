ECE241 Project - Audio recognition game using verilog, FPGA, VGA


-	Designed and implemented a musical training game, requiring players to match pitches with corresponding keys on a keyboard; using a Cyclone V FPGA programmed in Verilog for the finite state machines and the game algorithm.
-	Integrated VGA, audio output, and external memory using Intel Quartus and Modelsim to create an engaging game experience.
